## Coffee Machine Program ☕️

This is a Python-based coffee machine simulation that allows users to select drinks, check resource levels, make payments, and manage coffee preparation.

### How It Works

- The user is prompted to select a drink from the available options.
- If the user selects a drink, the machine checks if there are enough resources to make it.
- The user then proceeds to make a payment.
- If the payment is successful, the coffee is prepared.
- Users can also request a report on resource levels and earnings or turn off the machine.

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Download or clone the repo.
3. Ensure you have the required class files (`menu.py`, `coffee_maker.py`, `money_machine.py`) in the same directory as the script.
4. In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   python coffee_machine.py
