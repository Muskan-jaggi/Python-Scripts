# Caesar Cipher üîê

This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

## How It Works

- You can **encode** (encrypt) or **decode** (decrypt) a message.
- Input your message and the shift number, and the program will handle the rest.
  
### Example:
Encrypting `hello` with a shift of `5` gives `mjqqt`. Decoding it with the same shift restores `hello`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed. 
2. Download or clone the repo.
3. In the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter your message and shift number.
