## Caesar Cipher üîê

This is a simple Python implementation of the a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

### How It Works

- You can **encode** (encrypt) or **decode** (decrypt) a message.
- Input your message and the shift number, and the program will handle the rest.

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed. 
2. Download or clone the repo.
3. In the terminal, run:
   **python caesar_cipher.py**
    
4. Follow the prompts to enter your message and shift number.
