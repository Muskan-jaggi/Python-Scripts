## Basic Calculator ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

### How It Works

- The user is prompted to input two numbers.
- They then choose an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
- The result is displayed based on the operation chosen.

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed. 
2. Download or clone the repo.
3. In the terminal, run:
   **python basic_calculator.py**
    
4. Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers and the operator.
