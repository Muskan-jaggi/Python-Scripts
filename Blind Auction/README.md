# Blind Auction Script

This is a simple command-line blind auction program where participants can place bids, and the highest bidder is determined at the end.

## How It Works

1. Each participant enters their name and bid amount.
2. After each bid, you can choose whether more users want to bid.
3. When no more bids are placed, the highest bidder and their bid amount are displayed.
